macOS 11.6 (MacBook Pro, 2018)\

App has all basic functionalities. Should be straightforward to use :)\
Note: Implemented clear button feature for home/recognize screen. This is to retain matching results and give the user the option to clear it if/when they want to. Otherwise, results are refreshed and updated everytime the recognize button is clicked.
